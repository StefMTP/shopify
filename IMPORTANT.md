## Working with Shopify: Developing Apps and Interacting with its APIs

### Concepts and terms to know before starting:

Ecommerce = buying and selling online
Merchant = someone who sells items/services
Online store = the ecommerce website of a merchant
Store = a retail establishment for selling to customers
Collections = products grouped together into categories
Variant = products come in different options in a lot of stores, for example COLOR, or SIZE. That is why, merchants can add variants to a product to distinguish it. Each product may come with different combinations of various options. Each combination of options is a variant of each respective product.
Inventory = a store's complete list of VARIANTS
Item = one unit of a product (if there are variants, an item is one unit of a variant)
